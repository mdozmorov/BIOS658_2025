```

.small[
- **Bacteria** – a large domain of prokaryotic microorganisms. They lack a membrane-bound nucleus and have diverse shapes, metabolisms, and habitats.
- **Archaea** – a domain of single-celled prokaryotes distinct from bacteria; differ in membrane lipids, cell wall composition, and certain genetic machinery. Often inhabit extreme environments.
- **Eukaryota** – organisms whose cells contain a membrane-bound nucleus enclosed within a nuclear envelope, along with other membrane-bound organelles. ]

## Types of organisms, arranged by complexity

Viruses → Bacteria (and other prokaryotes) → Unicellular eukaryotes → Multicellular eukaryotes

- **Viruses** – acellular infectious agents with very small genomes (as little as ∼10,000 bp); require a host cell for replication.  

- **Prokaryotes** – simplest free-living cellular organisms (e.g., bacteria, archaea), typically with genomes of ∼1–5 million bp; lack a membrane-bound nucleus.  

- **Eukaryotes** – organisms whose cells contain membrane-bound organelles, including a nucleus (e.g., yeast, plants, animals).  

- **Multicellular eukaryotes** – composed of specialized cell types requiring differential gene expression and intercellular communication to maintain organismal function.  

---  
## Overview of Cellular Life

- **Cells** are the fundamental units of structure and function in all living organisms.  
- Each cell is a complex system with specialized substructures (organelles in eukaryotes) carrying out essential biological processes.

## The Genome: Blueprint of Life

**Genome** – The complete set of genetic material in an organism, including all of its DNA (or RNA in some viruses).

* Contains **genes** (coding sequences) and **noncoding regions** (regulatory elements, repetitive sequences, etc.)

* Organized into **chromosomes** (linear in eukaryotes, usually circular in prokaryotes)

* Encodes the instructions for building and maintaining the organism

* Inherited from parent(s) and passed to offspring

## The Genome: Blueprint of Life

Your genome, together with your environment and life experiences, influences who you are:

* Height
* Hair, eye, and skin color
* Shape and size of facial/body features
* Risk of developing certain diseases
* Response to medications
* Lifespan and cognitive abilities

Many physical traits are strongly determined by genetics.

## Eukaryotic cells and the genome

.pull-left[ 
* Each cell contains a complete copy of an organism’s genome — the blueprint for all cellular structures and functions.

* The genome is organized into chromosomes, composed of tightly packed and coiled DNA.

* Cells come in many types (e.g., blood, skin, nerve), yet all originate from a single fertilized egg.

## The nucleus

.pull-left[ 
* The nucleus is a specialized compartment found only in eukaryotic cells, housing the organism’s DNA.

* The nuclear membrane separates the nucleus from the cytoplasm, the rest of the cell’s interior.

* The entire cell is enclosed by the plasma membrane containing diverse proteins that function as channels and pumps, regulating movement into and out of the cell.

## Discovery of chromosomes

.pull-left[ 
* By the mid-1800s, microscopes were powerful enough to reveal unusual structures called **chromosomes**, which appeared to play a key role in cell division.

* Chromosomes could only be seen clearly when appropriate **stains** were applied.

* The term **“chromosome”** comes from Greek words meaning **“colored body.”**

## Chromosomes

* Chromosomes are packets of tightly coiled DNA located in the nucleus.

* Each chromosome carries a unique set of **genes**, and the specific location of a gene on a chromosome is called its **genetic locus**.

* Humans have **46 chromosomes**: 44 autosomes and 2 sex chromosomes. Autosomes occur in **pairs** (diploid).

* Because each autosome is present in two copies, there are **two alleles** of a gene at each locus.

* Germ cells (sperm and egg) carry only **one copy** of each chromosome and gene and are **haploid**.

---
## Centromere locations

* The **centromere** divides a chromosome into a short arm (**p**, for *petit*) and a long arm (**q**).

* It is defined by the first band on the short arm (**p10**) and the first band on the long arm (**q10**).

* **Telomeres** are located at the ends of the chromosome arms (**pter** and **qter**).

```

---
## Banding Patterns and Nomenclature

.pull-left[ 
* Each chromosome arm is divided into **regions** based on consistent, distinct landmarks.
* Regions are further subdivided into **bands** and **sub-bands**.
* The regions closest to the centromere are numbered **1** (p1 and q1).
* Numbers increase moving away from the centromere toward the chromosome ends.  
  * Example: **Xp22.3** = X chromosome, short arm, region 2, band 2, sub-band 3.
  * It is read as "**X p two-two point three**," not "**X p twenty-two point three**."

## Karyotype

.pull-left[ 
* **Cytogenetics** is the study of normal and abnormal chromosomes.
* The normal arrangement of chromosomes is called the **euploid** karyotype.
* **Euploidy** means that all autosomes are present in properly paired structures, and the sex chromosomes (X and Y) are present in the expected configuration for the individual’s sex.
* Deviations from the euploid state are called **aneuploidy**, which can include loss of chromosomes, extra copies, or other structural alterations.
