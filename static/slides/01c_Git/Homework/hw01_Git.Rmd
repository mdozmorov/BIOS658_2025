### Homework 01

# Git & GitHub Basics

## Part 1: Local Git

1. Create a new folder called `git-homework`.
2. Inside the folder, create a file called `hello.txt` and write your name inside.
3. Initialize a Git repository:  
```bash
   git init
```

4. Check the status of your repository. What does Git report?
5. Add `hello.txt` to the staging area and make your first commit with the message:
   `"First commit: add hello.txt"`

## Part 2: Working with Changes

1. Edit `hello.txt` and add todayâ€™s date.
2. Run `git status`. What do you see?
3. Stage and commit your changes with the message:
   `"Update hello.txt with date"`

## Part 3: GitHub Setup

1. Make sure you have a GitHub account. If not, create one at https://github.com/. Select professional username.
2. Configure your GitHub credentials and enable passwordless login (SSH key or HTTPS with a credential manager).
3. Create a new repository on GitHub called **git-homework** (without initializing with README).

## Part 4: Connecting Local & Remote

1. Connect your local repo to GitHub:

 ```bash
 git remote add origin git@github.com:USERNAME/git-homework.git
 ```
*(Replace `USERNAME` with your GitHub username.)*

2. Push your commits to the main branch:

 ```bash
 git branch -M main
 git push -u origin main
 ```

## Part 5: Questions

Answer briefly in a text file (`answers.txt`) and commit it to your repo:

* What is the difference between **git add** and **git commit**?
* What happens if you delete the `.git` folder?
* Why should you never share your private key (`id_rsa`)?

## Part 6: Submission

- Submit your GitHub username and the repository link.
