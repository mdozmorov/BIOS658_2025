## Introduction  

- **edgeR** is a Bioconductor package for differential expression $DE$ of count data (RNA-seq, SAGE, etc.). 

- It models read counts as an **overdispersed Poisson** $Negative Binomial$ distribution to account for both technical and biological variability.  

- The package can handle experiments with very few replicates by borrowing information across genes - Empirical Bayes method. 

- Key capabilities include two-group *exact tests* and generalized linear models GLMs with likelihood or quasi-likelihood tests.

## Negative Binomial Model  

- Let $Y_{gi}$ be the count for gene *g* in sample *i*. edgeR uses a **Negative Binomial $NB$** model: $Y_{gi} \sim \text{NB}\mu_{gi}, \phi_g$. 
- Here $\mu_{gi}=M_i p_{g}$ with $M_i$ = library size and $p_{g}$ = relative abundance of gene *g* (possibly depending on group).  

- Under this NB parameterization, $\mathbb{E}[Y_{gi}]=\mu_{gi}$ and 
  $$\mathrm{Var}Y_{gi} = \mu_{gi} + \phi_g\,\mu_{gi}^2$$
  which exceeds the Poisson variance by the dispersion term $\phi_g$. When $\phi_g=0$, the model reduces to Poisson.  

---
## Dispecrion

- The dispersion $\phi_g$ captures biological variability _coefficient of biological variation squared_. 

- The **biological coefficient of variation $BCV$** is defined as $\sqrt{\phi_g}$, representing the extra variability between replicates beyond Poisson noise.  

---
## Estimation of Dispersion  

Since each gene has few replicates, edgeR uses *borrowing information* across genes. It estimates:  

- **Common dispersion**: a single $\phi$ for all genes assumes identical mean-variance.  

- **Trended dispersion**: a smooth mean-dependent trend $\phi\bar\mu$ so genes with similar average count $\bar\mu$ share variance.  

- **Tagwise dispersion**: a gene-specific $\phi_g$, estimated with empirical Bayes shrinkage towards the common or trended values. This allows high-variability genes to have larger dispersions and stable genes to have smaller dispersions.  

---
## Estimation of Dispersion  

- edgeR uses an **Empirical Bayes** strategy: raw tagwise dispersions are “squeezed” toward a global trend or common value. The amount of shrinkage depends on data-driven prior degrees of freedom. This moderation stabilizes dispersion estimates, especially in small samples.  

- In practice, one calls `estimateDisp(y, design)` or `estimateCommonDisp`/`estimateTagwiseDisp` to compute these estimates. The result can be visualized $BCV plot$ to check the mean-variance trend.  

---
## Exact Test for Two-Group Comparison  

- For a simple two-group one-factor design, edgeR provides an *exact test* analogous to Fisher’s exact test but adapted to NB counts. It conditions on the library sizes and total counts for a gene, then computes p-values by summing tail probabilities under the NB null.  

- This **exactTest** is implemented via `exactTest()` in edgeR, allowing either common or tagwise dispersions. It is valid only for single-factor designs (it ignores other factors). The top genes can be retrieved by `topTags()`.  

```{r, eval=FALSE}
  y <- DGEList(counts=counts, group=group) 
  y <- calcNormFactors(y)             # TMM normalization 
  y <- estimateDisp(y)                # estimate dispersions (common/trended/tagwise)
  et <- exactTest(y)                  # perform exact test for two groups
  topTags(et)                         # top DE genes
```

The exact test is most powerful for small sample, two-group comparisons

---
## Generalized Linear Models (GLMs)

- For complex experiments (multifactor, batches, interactions), edgeR uses a NB GLM framework

- We specify a design matrix $X$ encoding factors. The model is $\log(\mu_{gi}) = X_i \beta_g + logL_i$ (log-linear). Offsets ($logL_i$ log library size) are included automatically.

- Dispersions (common/trended/tagwise) are estimated as before but respecting the design

- Then gene-wise coefficients $\beta_g$ are fitted by conditional maximum likelihood (Cox-Reid adjusted) via `glmFit()`.

---
## Generalized Linear Models (GLMs)

- Differential expression tests compare coefficients (contrasts) using:
  - Likelihood ratio tests (`glmLRT`) for NB GLMs
  - Quasi-likelihood F-tests (`glmQLFTest`) for more robust inference (see next slide).

- Example: for a design matrix design <- model.matrix(~ group + batch), one could do:
```{r, eval=FALSE}
fit <- glmQLFit(y, design)         # fit NB GLM with QL dispersion
qlf <- glmQLFTest(fit, coef=2)     # test for group effect
topTags(qlf)
```

(Here coef=2 tests the second coefficient, e.g. group effect.)

---
## Quasi-Likelihood (QL) Methods

EdgeR also implements **quasi-likelihood (QL)** models to capture additional variability. In the QL framework, the variance is given by:

$$\mathrm{Var}(Y_{gi}) = \sigma_g^2(\mu_{gi} + \phi \mu_{gi}^2)$$

where $\phi$ is the **global Negative Binomial (NB) dispersion** and $\sigma_g^2$ is a **gene-specific QL dispersion**. 

- Any excess variance (beyond NB) is absorbed into $\sigma_g^2$. Here, $\phi$ reflects overall biological variability, and $\sigma_g^2$ captures gene-wise overdispersion beyond the NB model. This makes tests more conservative and robust to model violations.

---
## Quasi-Likelihood (QL) Methods

- Estimation first involves fitting a common or trended $\phi$, then estimating raw QL dispersions $\sigma_g^2$ for each gene. These raw estimates are very noisy with few replicates, so edgeR applies an **Empirical Bayes** fit: the raw QL dispersions are trended by mean, then shrunk toward that trend.

- The result is a **moderated QL dispersion** for each gene, which is used in the `glmQLFit()` and `glmQLFTest()` functions. These quasi-likelihood F-tests are often preferred for controlling false discoveries in small-sample RNA-seq.

---
## Empirical Bayes Shrinkage

- A hallmark of **edgeR** is **Empirical Bayes (EB) shrinkage** of dispersion estimates. **Tagwise dispersions** $\phi_g$ are moderated toward a global trend or common value. This pooling increases power and stability: even genes with few counts get reasonable $\phi_g$ estimates.

- Robinson and Smyth (2007, 2008) showed that this moderated dispersion approach yields reliable testing even with only 1–2 replicates per condition. In practice, **prior degrees of freedom** are estimated from the data, determining the strength of the shrinkage.

---
## Empirical Bayes Shrinkage

- Shrinkage of Fold Changes: edgeR also moderates **log-fold-changes (LFCs)** for very low counts. When computing normalized log-CPM (counts per million), a **prior count** (e.g., `prior.count=0.25`) is added. This has the effect of shrinking LFCs toward $0$ for low-abundance genes, which avoids infinite or wildly large LFCs.

In summary, edgeR's Bayesian machinery yields stable estimates of dispersions and shrunk effect sizes, enhancing inference reliability.

---
## Case Study: Two-Group DE Example

- Setup: Simulate or load counts for two groups (e.g. 3 controls vs 3 treated). Build a DGEList, normalize and estimate dispersion:

```{r eval=FALSE}
group <- factor(c(rep("Ctrl",3), rep("Trt",3)))
y <- DGEList(counts=counts, group=group)
y <- calcNormFactors(y)      # TMM normalization
y <- estimateDisp(y)         # estimate common/trended/tagwise
plotBCV(y)                   # (optional) BCV vs logCPM plot
```

Exact Test: For simple two-group, use:

```{r eval=FALSE}
et <- exactTest(y)           # exact test for group
topTags(et)
```

This will list DE genes ranked by fold-change and p-value

---
## Case Study: Two-Group DE Example

GLM/QL Test: Alternatively (especially if adjusting for batches), use GLM-QF:

```{r eval=FALSE}
design <- model.matrix(~group)
fit <- glmQLFit(y, design)
qlf <- glmQLFTest(fit, coef=2)   # test group effect
topTags(qlf)
```

The output lists log-fold-changes and FDR-adjusted p-values. For example, genes with large $\log_2$FC and small FDR are called DE. (One can visualize results with MA-plots via plotSmear(y, de.tags=...).)

## Fractional Counts in Sequencing Data

* Quantification tools (e.g., **RSEM**, **Salmon**, **Kallisto**) **distribute read counts fractionally** among possible targets based on posterior probabilities.

* Transcript abundance estimation often uses **expectation–maximization (EM)** algorithms. 
  * Each iteration assigns **fractional weights** of reads to transcripts depending on compatibility with isoform structures.
  * Leads to **non-integer expression estimates** per transcript.

---
## Continuous Generalization of the Negative Binomial Distribution

* Traditional **NB models** assume **integer read counts**.

* Rounding fractional values leads to **information loss** and **bias in dispersion estimation**.

* **edgeR v4** introduces a **continuous generalization** of the NB distribution.

* Allows **fractional counts** without rounding by extending NB probability calculations to the **real domain**.

* Implemented via **divided counts** (Baldoni et al., 2024–2025):
  * Fractionalized reads represent **uncertainty from ambiguous assignment**.
  * Variance function preserved: $\mathrm{Var}(y_{gi}) = \sigma_g^2 (\mu_{gi} + \phi_g \mu_{gi}^2)$
  * Technical variability (σ²) and biological variability (ψ) remain estimable.

* Supports new applications: **differential transcript usage**, **methylation**, **fractional read assignments**.
