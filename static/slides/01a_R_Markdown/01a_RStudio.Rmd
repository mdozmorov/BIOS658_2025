## RStudio

- RStudio is a program that allows you to run R in a more user-friendly environment  
  
- RStudio offers some GUI (graphical user interface) features for R  

- RStudio can be considered an "R portal"  

- The same R program is running underneath the interface  

- RStudio is open-source software (and therefore is free)  

- After you install R and RStudio, you only need to run RStudio
