Use Hugo, Markdown. Implement the front page and make menu entries for the syllabus, schedule, classes with class-specific pages listed in the left scroll panel. Individual class pages should be linkable to entries in the schedule. Class pages should link to the Xaringan lecture slides. Create example pages for each page, and for a couple of class pages and lectures. Add anything else that is typically included in course websites. Create individual files that I can download and put in a GitHub repository to serve on GitHub pages.

# Prerequisites

BIOS 524. Biostatistical Computing. 3 Hours.
Semester course; 3 lecture hours (delivered online or face-to-face). 3 credits. Techniques for biostatistical computing are presented by way of contemporary statistical packages. Students learn how to create and manage computer data files. Methods for data entry, preparation of data for analysis and summaritive procedures are covered. Students learn the basics of random number generation and its applications, numerical methods for statistical algorithms, and concepts of numerical accuracy and stability. Advanced topics include interactive matrix and macro languages. Emphasis is placed on computational methods and data management rather than on statistical methods and procedures.

BIOS 544. Graduate Research Methods II. 3 Hours.
Semester course; 3 lecture hours (delivered online or face-to-face). 3 credits. Prerequisite: BIOS 543 or STAT 543 or permission of instructor. This course is intended for graduate students and researchers without formal training in the statistical and biostatistical sciences. Students enrolled in this course will study various aspects of statistical model-building, including adjusting estimates for other measurements, creating multivariate models, analyzing noncontinuous outcomes and summarizing results. Particularly, students will learn multiple linear regression, multifactor analysis of variance, analysis of covariance, random and mixed effects models, repeated measure and longitudinal data analysis, logistic and Poisson regressions, and time-to-event analysis. These topics will be covered through a variety of approaches, including traditional lecture, group discussion and in-class activities, and students will be assessed on their ability to understand statistical considerations in the model-building process, appropriately perform intermediate statistical procedures and report statistical findings using the IMRaD format. The appropriate use of data management and statistical procedures will be modeled using several commonly used software packages. Students may receive degree credit for only one of BIOS 544 or STAT 544.

BIOS 654. Biostatistical Methods II. 4 Hours.
Semester course; 4 lecture hours. 4 credits. Prerequisite: BIOS 653. Continued study of applied biostatistical concepts intended primarily for graduate students in the Department of Biostatistics. Topics include categorical data analysis, generalized linear models, generalized linear mixed models, generalized additive models, nonlinear regression and survival analysis.
