# Introduction

This document demonstrates **permutation testing** for assessing gene enrichment on a specific chromosome. The key question is: **Are differentially expressed genes (DEGs) over-represented on a particular chromosome compared to what we'd expect by chance?**

Permutation testing is a non-parametric approach that:
- Makes no assumptions about the underlying distribution
- Creates an empirical null distribution through random sampling
- Provides an alternative to parametric tests like Fisher's exact test or Chi-square test

# Background: The Biological Question

Imagine you have:

- **200 total genes** in your study (e.g., from a gene expression experiment)
- **40 genes are located on Chromosome 1**, and 160 genes are on other chromosomes
- You identify **50 differentially expressed genes (DEGs)**
- Among these 50 DEGs, **15 are on Chromosome 1**

**Question:** Is Chromosome 1 enriched for DEGs, or could this pattern occur by random chance?

# Setting Up the Data

## Total Gene Population

First, we define the complete set of genes in our analysis, classified by their chromosomal location.

```{r total-genes}
# Create vector representing all genes in the study
# 40 genes on Chromosome 1, 160 on other chromosomes
a <- c(rep("On Other Chromosomes", 160), rep("On Chromosome 1", 40)) 

# Calculate totals
total.all   <- length(a)                        # Total genes (200)
total.chr   <- sum(a == "On Chromosome 1")      # Genes on Chromosome 1 (40)
total.other <- sum(a == "On Other Chromosomes") # Genes on other chromosomes (160)

# Verify totals add up correctly
all.equal(total.all, total.chr + total.other)

cat("Total genes:", total.all, "\n")
cat("Genes on Chromosome 1:", total.chr, "(", round(100*total.chr/total.all, 1), "%)\n")
cat("Genes on other chromosomes:", total.other, "(", round(100*total.other/total.all, 1), "%)\n")
```

## Differentially Expressed Genes (DEGs)

Next, we define which genes are differentially expressed in our experiment.

```{r deg-genes}
# Selected genes (DEGs): 50 total
# 15 on Chromosome 1, 35 on other chromosomes
b <- c(rep("On Other Chromosomes", 35), rep("On Chromosome 1", 15))

selected.chr   <- sum(b == "On Chromosome 1")      # DEGs on Chromosome 1 (15)
selected.other <- sum(b == "On Other Chromosomes") # DEGs on other chromosomes (35)

cat("Total DEGs:", length(b), "\n")
cat("DEGs on Chromosome 1:", selected.chr, "(", round(100*selected.chr/length(b), 1), "%)\n")
cat("DEGs on other chromosomes:", selected.other, "(", round(100*selected.other/length(b), 1), "%)\n")
```

**Observation:** While only 20% of all genes are on Chromosome 1, **30% of DEGs** are on Chromosome 1. This suggests possible enrichment.

# Creating the Contingency Table

A 2Ã—2 contingency table summarizes the relationship between chromosomal location and differential expression status.

```{r contingency-table}
# Create 2x2 contingency table
#                    DEGs    not DEGs
# On Chromosome 1      15         25   (40 total)
# Other Chromosomes    35        125   (160 total)
#                     (50)      (150)  (200 total)

mtx <- matrix(c(selected.chr, 
                selected.other, 
                total.chr - selected.chr, 
                total.other - selected.other), 
              ncol = 2, 
              dimnames = list(c("On Chromosome 1", "On Other Chromosomes"), 
                              c("DEGs", "not DEGs")))

print(mtx)
cat("\nTotal genes (verification):", sum(mtx), "\n")
```

**Reading the table:**

- **Row 1:** Of 40 genes on Chromosome 1, 15 are DEGs and 25 are not
- **Row 2:** Of 160 genes on other chromosomes, 35 are DEGs and 125 are not
- **Column 1:** Of 50 DEGs total, 15 are on Chromosome 1 and 35 are elsewhere
- **Column 2:** Of 150 non-DEGs, 25 are on Chromosome 1 and 125 are elsewhere

# Traditional Statistical Tests

## Fisher's Exact Test

Fisher's exact test calculates the exact probability of observing this contingency table (or more extreme) under the null hypothesis of independence.

```{r fisher-test}
fisher_p <- fisher.test(mtx)$p.value
cat("Fisher's exact test p-value:", fisher_p, "\n")

if (fisher_p < 0.05) {
  cat("Result: Significant enrichment detected (p < 0.05)\n")
} else {
  cat("Result: No significant enrichment (p >= 0.05)\n")
}
```

**Interpretation:** Fisher's exact test is the gold standard for small sample contingency tables and provides an exact p-value without relying on asymptotic approximations.

## Chi-Square Test

The Chi-square test of independence assesses whether the two categorical variables (chromosomal location and DEG status) are independent.

```{r chisq-test}
chisq_p <- chisq.test(mtx)$p.value
cat("Chi-square test p-value:", chisq_p, "\n")

if (chisq_p < 0.05) {
  cat("Result: Significant association detected (p < 0.05)\n")
} else {
  cat("Result: No significant association (p >= 0.05)\n")
}
```

**Note:** Chi-square test uses asymptotic approximations and may be less accurate for small sample sizes, but gives similar results to Fisher's test in most cases.

# Permutation Testing Approach 1: Using Test Statistics

## Concept

Instead of relying on theoretical distributions, we create an **empirical null distribution** by:
1. Randomly selecting 50 genes (same size as our DEG set) from all 200 genes
2. Calculating the Chi-square statistic for each random selection
3. Repeating this process many times (10,000 permutations)
4. Comparing our observed statistic to this empirical distribution

**Null Hypothesis:** DEGs are randomly distributed with respect to chromosomal location.

## Implementation

```{r permutation-chisq}
set.seed(2)  # For reproducibility

# Number of permutations
n <- 1:10000

# Observed test statistic from our actual data
estimate <- chisq.test(mtx)$statistic
cat("Observed Chi-square statistic:", round(estimate, 3), "\n\n")

# Generate permutation distribution
estimate.rand <- sapply(n, function(x) {
  # Randomly select 50 genes from all 200 genes (without replacement)
  b.rand <- sample(a, size = length(b))
  
  # Count how many randomly selected genes are on each chromosome
  selected.chr.rand <- sum(b.rand == "On Chromosome 1")
  selected.other.rand <- sum(b.rand == "On Other Chromosomes")
  
  # Create permutation contingency table
  mtx.rand <- matrix(c(selected.chr.rand, 
                       selected.other.rand, 
                       total.chr - selected.chr.rand, 
                       total.other - selected.other.rand), 
                     ncol = 2)
  
  # Calculate Chi-square statistic for this permutation
  chisq.test(mtx.rand)$statistic
})

# Calculate permutation p-value
perm_p_chisq <- (sum(estimate.rand >= estimate) + 1) / (length(n) + 1)
cat("Permutation p-value (Chi-square method):", perm_p_chisq, "\n")
```

## Visualizing the Permutation Distribution

```{r permutation-viz-chisq, fig.width=8, fig.height=5}
# Plot histogram of permutation distribution
hist(estimate.rand, 
     breaks = 50, 
     main = "Permutation Distribution of Chi-square Statistics",
     xlab = "Chi-square Statistic",
     col = "lightblue",
     border = "white")

# Add observed statistic as vertical line
abline(v = estimate, col = "red", lwd = 2, lty = 2)

# Add legend
legend("topright", 
       legend = c("Permutation distribution", 
                  paste("Observed statistic =", round(estimate, 2))),
       col = c("lightblue", "red"), 
       lwd = c(10, 2), 
       lty = c(1, 2))

# Add text with p-value
text(x = max(estimate.rand) * 0.7, 
     y = max(hist(estimate.rand, plot = FALSE)$counts) * 0.9,
     labels = paste("Permutation p-value =", perm_p_chisq),
     cex = 1.2)
```

**Interpretation:** The red line shows our observed Chi-square statistic. The permutation p-value represents the proportion of random permutations that produced a statistic as extreme or more extreme than what we observed.

# Permutation Testing Approach 2: Using Count Differences

## Concept

A simpler approach focuses directly on the **count** of DEGs on Chromosome 1:

- **Expected under null:** If DEGs are randomly distributed, we expect ~20% of 50 DEGs (= 10 genes) on Chromosome 1
- **Observed:** We actually see 15 DEGs on Chromosome 1
- **Question:** How often would we see 15 or more genes on Chromosome 1 by random chance?

## Implementation

```{r permutation-count}
set.seed(1)  # For reproducibility
n <- 1:10000

# Observed count of DEGs on Chromosome 1
estimate <- selected.chr
cat("Observed DEGs on Chromosome 1:", estimate, "\n")
cat("Expected DEGs on Chromosome 1 (under null):", 
    round(length(b) * total.chr / total.all, 1), "\n\n")

# Generate permutation distribution of counts
estimate.rand <- sapply(n, function(x) {
  # Randomly select 50 genes from all 200 genes
  b.rand <- sample(a, size = length(b))
  
  # Count how many are on Chromosome 1
  sum(b.rand == "On Chromosome 1")
})

# Calculate permutation p-value
# Count how often random selection gives >= observed count
perm_p_count <- sum(estimate.rand >= estimate) / length(n)
cat("Permutation p-value (count method):", perm_p_count, "\n")
```

## Visualizing the Count Distribution

```{r permutation-viz-count, fig.width=8, fig.height=5}
# Plot histogram of permutation counts
hist(estimate.rand, 
     breaks = seq(min(estimate.rand) - 0.5, max(estimate.rand) + 0.5, by = 1),
     main = "Permutation Distribution of DEG Counts on Chromosome 1",
     xlab = "Number of DEGs on Chromosome 1",
     col = "lightgreen",
     border = "white")

# Add observed count as vertical line
abline(v = estimate, col = "red", lwd = 2, lty = 2)

# Add expected count as vertical line
expected_count <- length(b) * total.chr / total.all
abline(v = expected_count, col = "blue", lwd = 2, lty = 3)

# Add legend
legend("topright", 
       legend = c("Permutation distribution", 
                  paste("Observed count =", estimate),
                  paste("Expected count =", round(expected_count, 1))),
       col = c("lightgreen", "red", "blue"), 
       lwd = c(10, 2, 2), 
       lty = c(1, 2, 3))

# Add text with p-value
text(x = max(estimate.rand) * 0.85, 
     y = max(hist(estimate.rand, plot = FALSE)$counts) * 0.9,
     labels = paste("Permutation p-value =", perm_p_count),
     cex = 1.2)
```

**Interpretation:** The distribution shows what we'd expect by random chance. The red line (observed = 15) is notably higher than the blue line (expected â‰ˆ 10), indicating enrichment.

results <- data.frame(
  Method = c("Fisher's Exact Test",

  P_Value = c(fisher_p, chisq_p, perm_p_chisq, perm_p_count),
  Significant = c(fisher_p < 0.05, 
                  chisq_p < 0.05, 
                  perm_p_chisq < 0.05, 
                  perm_p_count < 0.05)

# Key Insights

## Advantages of Permutation Testing

1. **No distributional assumptions:** Works regardless of data distribution
2. **Exact for finite samples:** Especially valuable for small sample sizes
3. **Intuitive interpretation:** Directly answers "How often would we see this by chance?"
4. **Flexible:** Can use any test statistic, not just standard ones

## When to Use Permutation Tests

- Small sample sizes where asymptotic approximations may fail
- When distributional assumptions of parametric tests are violated
- When you need an exact test but Fisher's exact is computationally prohibitive
- When you want to use a custom test statistic

## Computational Considerations

- **Number of permutations:** More permutations = more precise p-value
  - 1,000 permutations: precision Â± 0.01
  - 10,000 permutations: precision Â± 0.003
  - Use at least 1,000 for published work
- **Computational cost:** Increases linearly with number of permutations
- **Random seed:** Always set for reproducibility

# Conclusions

In this example, all methods (Fisher's exact, Chi-square, and both permutation approaches) give similar results, suggesting that:

1. **Chromosome 1 shows enrichment for DEGs** if p < 0.05
2. **The enrichment is robust** across different statistical approaches
3. **Permutation tests validate** the parametric test results

The permutation approach is particularly valuable because it:
- Provides an independent validation of traditional tests
- Offers intuitive visualization of the null distribution
- Works well even with small sample sizes or violated assumptions
