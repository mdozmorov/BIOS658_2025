<h2>Course Overview</h2>
<!-- This course introduces deep learning concepts using R, with hands-on exercises. The focus will be on implementing deep learning models and exploring various architectures using the "Deep Learning with R" textbook by François Chollet and J. J. Allaire. The course will cover both foundational and advanced topics in deep learning, including computer vision, natural language processing, and generative models. -->
<p>Welcome to BIOS 658. This course is the first part of the Genomics curriculum, aimed to introduce core principles of Data Science, Genomics, Bioinformatics and Biostatistics. This is a blended course that combines in-class learning (lectures, labs) with self-directed activities.</p>
<p>Bioinformatics is interdisciplinary computer science, requiring a knowledge base in biology, technology, and statistics. The operational definition of ‘bioinformatics’ for this course is “The application of biotechnology and statistical methods to the study of biological problems.” The biological problems on which we will focus are primarily gene expression studies conducted using RNA-seq technology.</p>
<p>The class will be conducted in person and include lecture and coding parts. Course material will be publicly available. The syllabus is subject to change. Observe the <a href="https://students.vcu.edu/studentconduct/vcu-honor-system/academic-misconduct-/honor-pledge/">VCU Honor Pledge</a> in any class- and homework activities.</p>
