## Genes and genome

* **Genes** are discrete hereditary units located on chromosomes (DNA).

* Each gene provides specific instructions for producing a particular trait or function in the organism.

* The complete set of genes in an organism is called its **genome**.


---
## Building blocks of DNA

* The basic unit, a **nucleotide**, consists of an organic **base** attached to a deoxyribose **sugar**.

* A **phosphate** group is also attached to the sugar.

* The **base** can be one of four types: **cytosine (C), thymine (T), adenine (A), or guanine (G)**.

## Getting to know DNA: Gel electrophoresis

* In the mid-1900s, methods were developed to separate and visualize DNA using an electrically charged gel (originally made from sugar).

* DNA samples are loaded into “lanes” at the top of the gel, and an electric field is applied.

* Smaller DNA fragments migrate faster and move farther down the gel, while larger fragments remain closer to the top.

* This allows detection of DNA and comparison of relative fragment lengths.

* One lane is often reserved for a **DNA ladder**, a set of fragments of known sizes.

---
## Genomic DNA

* DNA is a **double helix**, with bases oriented inward (like rungs of a ladder) and sugar-phosphate backbones forming the outer sides (like the rails of a twisted ladder).

* The two strands are **complementary**, following Watson-Crick base-pairing rules.

* **A** (a purine) pairs with **T** (a pyrimidine), and **C** (a pyrimidine) pairs with **G** (a purine).

* Base pairs are held together by **hydrogen bonds**, and the twisting of the helix results from the geometry of these interactions.

## Double strand: DNA base pairing

## Rules of base pairing

- Rules of base pairing: A-T(U), C-G (and G-U in RNA)

```

---
## Base pairing

* Base pairs are held together by weak **hydrogen bonds**.

* While each bond is weak individually, their cumulative effect across the strands provides strong overall stability.

* This makes DNA chemically stable and an effective carrier of genetic information.
