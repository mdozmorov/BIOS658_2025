## Graphics in R

R has powerful graphical facilities

- Easily produce standard statistical graphs
- Allows you to create new types of graphs
- Create publication quality graphs
- Many packages provide powerful plotting functions
- Lots of free reference material available


## Producing graphics in R not always easy

- Need to know the right function and how to set its arguments
- Arguments are not always intuitive
- Data sometimes need to be in certain format or shape
- Error messages not always helpful

It's OK. Everyone struggles with R Graphics from time to time. Google can help you.

## Workshop Plan

Follow along in R Studio as we learn about the following:

- R’s plotting framework
- How to do common graphs
- ggplot2 package
- Examples of package-specific plotting functions

## R graphics framework

R graphics are created with three kinds of functions:

- **High-level functions**: create a graphic
- **Low-level functions**: add to an existing graphic
- **Interactive functions**: add or extract information from a graph, typically with a mouse

All functions have arguments that specify how they work.

In addition R has separate **graphical parameters** that apply to the display of graphics.

## High-level function example


```{r, fig.height=3.5,fig.width=6}
plot(x = mtcars$hp, y = mtcars$mpg)
```


## Low-level function example

```{r, fig.height=3.5,fig.width=6}
plot(x = mtcars$hp, y = mtcars$mpg)
points(x = 300, y = 30, pch = 19, col = "red")
```


## Graphical Parameters example

```{r, fig.height=3, fig.width=7}
par(mfrow=c(1,2))
hist(mtcars$hp); hist(mtcars$mpg)
```

Let's go to R!

## ggplot2

- Popular graphing package that implements Leland Wilkinson’s _Grammar of Graphics_ (2005)
- Features consistent coding
- Works in a layered fashion, first showing raw data and then adding layers of annotations and summaries
- Provides very nice default theme
- Handles legends beautifully

## ggplot2 - the components

- Data and aesthetic mappings (**data** and **aes**)
- Geometric objects represent what you see on plot (**geoms**)
- Statistical transformations summarize data (**stats**)
- Scales that map values from data to the graph (**scale**)
- A coordinate system (**coord**)
- A faceting specification that describes how to lay out data (**facet**)


## basic ggplot structure

**Specify data and aesthetics**   
`ggplot(data, aes(x=, y=, color=, shape=, size=)) +`   

**Specify geometric shapes**  
`geom_xxxxx() +`   

**Specify statistical, scale or coordinate changes**   
`stat_xxxx() +` or `scale_xxxx() +` or `coord_xxxx() +`   

**Specify how to layout multiple graphs**   
`facet_xxxx()`   

## ggplot example

```{r, message=FALSE, fig.height=3, fig.width=6}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(iris, aes(x = Petal.Width, y = Petal.Length, 
                 color=Species)) + 
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method="lm") + 
  ggtitle("Petals of the Iris data set") 

```


## ggplot - the catch

- Data must be a data frame
- Data must be in _long_ format, which could mean reshaping data
- The package is young and still evolving (ie, code that works today may not work in the future)
- Consistent interface, yes, but still many arguments to keep track of

Let’s go to R...
