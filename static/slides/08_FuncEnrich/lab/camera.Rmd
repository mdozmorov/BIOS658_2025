# Introduction

This tutorial demonstrates how to perform **competitive gene set testing** using **CAMERA** (Correlation Adjusted MEan RAnk gene set test) from the `limma` package.

## What is CAMERA?

**CAMERA** is a competitive gene set test that:

- Tests whether genes in a pathway are **MORE differentially expressed** than genes **NOT in the pathway**
- Accounts for **inter-gene correlation**, which is crucial because genes in pathways often work together
- Provides directional enrichment (up or down-regulated pathways)
- Is generally more powerful than older methods like GSEA for microarray data

## Competitive vs Self-Contained Tests

- **Competitive tests (CAMERA)**: Compare genes in the set vs. genes outside the set
  - Question: "Are these genes MORE DE than other genes?"
  - Null hypothesis: Genes in set are no more DE than genes outside
  
- **Self-contained tests (ROAST/MROAST/FRY)**: Compare genes in the set vs. no differential expression
  - Question: "Are these genes DE?"
  - Null hypothesis: No genes in the set are DE

In this tutorial, we'll use the **ALL (Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia)** dataset to compare B-cell vs T-cell samples and identify enriched KEGG pathways.

---

# 1. Load Required Packages

We need several Bioconductor packages for this analysis:

```{r load-packages}
library(limma)
library(ALL)
library(hgu95av2.db)
library(org.Hs.eg.db)
library(clusterProfiler)
```

**Package purposes:**

- `limma`: Differential expression and CAMERA analysis
- `ALL`: The acute lymphoblastic leukemia dataset
- `hgu95av2.db`: Microarray platform annotations
- `org.Hs.eg.db`: Human gene annotations and KEGG pathways
- `clusterProfiler`: For downloading KEGG pathway descriptions

---

# 2. Load and Prepare the ALL Dataset

The ALL dataset contains gene expression profiles from patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia. We'll compare B-cell and T-cell subtypes.

```{r load-data}
# Load the dataset
data(ALL)

# Examine the dataset structure
print(ALL)

# View sample information
print("Sample phenotype data (first 5 samples, first 5 columns):")
print(pData(ALL)[1:5, 1:5])
```

## 2.1 Select Samples for Comparison

We'll focus on comparing B-cell and T-cell ALL samples.

```{r select-samples}
# Identify B-cell samples (includes B, B1, B2, B3, B4 subtypes)
bcell_samples <- which(ALL$BT %in% c("B", "B1", "B2", "B3", "B4"))

# Identify T-cell samples
tcell_samples <- which(ALL$BT == "T")

# Create a subset with B-cell and T-cell samples
# Using 10 B-cell and all T-cell samples for a balanced comparison
samples_to_keep <- c(bcell_samples[1:10], tcell_samples)
ALL_subset <- ALL[, samples_to_keep]

cat("Number of samples selected:\n")
cat("  B-cell samples:", length(bcell_samples[1:10]), "\n")
cat("  T-cell samples:", length(tcell_samples), "\n")
cat("  Total:", length(samples_to_keep), "\n")
```

---

# 3. Preprocessing and Design Matrix

We extract the expression data and create a design matrix for the linear model.

```{r preprocessing}
# Extract expression data
exprs_data <- exprs(ALL_subset)

# Create cell type factor
cell_type <- factor(ifelse(ALL_subset$BT == "T", "T", "B"))

# Create design matrix (group-means parameterization)
design <- model.matrix(~0 + cell_type)
colnames(design) <- c("B_cell", "T_cell")

cat("Design matrix structure:\n")
print(head(design))

cat("\nSample distribution:\n")
print(table(cell_type))
```

**Design matrix notes:**

- We use `~0 + cell_type` for a group-means parameterization
- This makes it easier to specify contrasts between groups
- Each column represents one cell type

---

# 4. Differential Expression Analysis

We use `limma` to identify differentially expressed genes between T-cell and B-cell samples.

```{r differential-expression}
# Fit linear model
fit <- lmFit(exprs_data, design)

# Define contrast: T-cell vs B-cell
contrast_matrix <- makeContrasts(
  TvsB = T_cell - B_cell,
  levels = design
)

cat("Contrast matrix:\n")
print(contrast_matrix)

# Fit contrasts and apply empirical Bayes moderation
fit2 <- contrasts.fit(fit, contrast_matrix)
fit2 <- eBayes(fit2)

# View top differentially expressed genes
top_genes <- topTable(fit2, coef = "TvsB", number = 20)

cat("\nTop 20 differentially expressed genes:\n")
print(top_genes[, c("logFC", "AveExpr", "t", "P.Value", "adj.P.Val")])
```

**Key statistics:**

- **logFC**: Log2 fold change (T-cell vs B-cell)
- **AveExpr**: Average expression across all samples
- **t**: Moderated t-statistic
- **P.Value**: Raw p-value
- **adj.P.Val**: FDR-adjusted p-value (Benjamini-Hochberg)

---

# 5. Prepare KEGG Pathway Gene Sets

Gene set testing requires mapping microarray probes to genes and then to pathways.

## 5.1 Map Probes to Entrez Gene IDs

```{r map-probes}
# Get probe to Entrez Gene ID mapping from the array annotation
probe_to_entrez <- as.list(hgu95av2ENTREZID)
probe_to_entrez <- probe_to_entrez[!is.na(probe_to_entrez)]

# Map our probes to Entrez IDs
probe_ids <- rownames(exprs_data)
entrez_mapping <- unlist(probe_to_entrez[probe_ids])
entrez_mapping <- entrez_mapping[!is.na(entrez_mapping)]

cat("Probe to gene mapping:\n")
cat("  Total probes in dataset:", length(probe_ids), "\n")
cat("  Probes mapped to Entrez IDs:", length(entrez_mapping), "\n")
cat("  Mapping rate:", round(100 * length(entrez_mapping) / length(probe_ids), 1), "%\n")
```

## 5.2 Get KEGG Pathway Annotations

We use `org.Hs.egPATH` to map Entrez Gene IDs to KEGG pathway IDs.

```{r kegg-pathways}
# Get gene-to-pathway mapping
pathway_map <- org.Hs.egPATH
mapped_genes <- mappedkeys(pathway_map)
gene_to_pathway <- as.list(pathway_map[mapped_genes])

cat("Gene-to-pathway mapping:\n")
cat("  Total genes mapped to pathways:", length(gene_to_pathway), "\n")
cat("  Example - first gene:", names(gene_to_pathway)[1], "\n")
cat("  Pathways for this gene:", paste(gene_to_pathway[[1]], collapse = ", "), "\n")
```

## 5.3 Invert to Pathway-to-Genes Mapping

CAMERA requires a list where each pathway contains its member genes.

```{r invert-mapping}
# Create pathway-to-genes mapping
pathway_to_genes <- list()

for (gene_id in names(gene_to_pathway)) {
  pathways <- gene_to_pathway[[gene_id]]
  for (pathway_id in pathways) {
    if (is.null(pathway_to_genes[[pathway_id]])) {
      pathway_to_genes[[pathway_id]] <- character(0)
    }
    pathway_to_genes[[pathway_id]] <- c(pathway_to_genes[[pathway_id]], gene_id)
  }
}

cat("Pathway-to-genes mapping:\n")
cat("  Total KEGG pathways:", length(pathway_to_genes), "\n")
cat("  First few pathway IDs:", paste(names(pathway_to_genes)[1:5], collapse = ", "), "\n")
```

## 5.4 Create Gene Set Index Lists

CAMERA requires pathways as lists of row indices in the expression matrix.

```{r gene-set-indices}
create_gene_set_indices <- function(pathway_list, gene_mapping, min_genes = 10) {
  pathway_indices <- list()
  
  for (pathway_id in names(pathway_list)) {
    # Get genes in this pathway
    pathway_genes <- pathway_list[[pathway_id]]
    
    # Find probes that map to these genes
    probes_in_pathway <- names(gene_mapping)[gene_mapping %in% pathway_genes]
    
    # Get row indices of these probes in expression matrix
    indices <- which(rownames(exprs_data) %in% probes_in_pathway)
    
    # Only keep pathways with sufficient genes for statistical power
    if (length(indices) >= min_genes) {
      pathway_indices[[pathway_id]] <- indices
    }
  }
  
  return(pathway_indices)
}

gene_set_indices <- create_gene_set_indices(pathway_to_genes, entrez_mapping)

cat("Gene set indices for CAMERA:\n")
cat("  Pathways with â‰¥10 genes:", length(gene_set_indices), "\n")
cat("  Example - Pathway", names(gene_set_indices)[1], "\n")
cat("    has", length(gene_set_indices[[1]]), "genes in the dataset\n")
```

**Why filter by pathway size?**

- Pathways with very few genes have limited statistical power
- Small gene sets may produce unreliable enrichment results
- A minimum of 10-15 genes is standard practice

---

# 6. Run CAMERA Analysis

CAMERA performs competitive gene set testing while accounting for inter-gene correlation.

```{r camera-analysis}
# Run CAMERA
camera_results <- camera(
  y = exprs_data,
  index = gene_set_indices,
  design = design,
  contrast = contrast_matrix[, "TvsB"],
  inter.gene.cor = 0.01
)

cat("CAMERA analysis complete!\n")
cat("  Pathways tested:", nrow(camera_results), "\n\n")

cat("Top 15 enriched KEGG pathways:\n")
print(head(camera_results, 15))
```

**CAMERA parameters:**

- **y**: Expression data matrix
- **index**: List of gene set indices
- **design**: Design matrix
- **contrast**: The contrast to test
- **inter.gene.cor**: Assumed inter-gene correlation
  - `0.01`: Small positive correlation (default assumption)
  - `NA`: Estimate from data (slower but more accurate)
  - Higher values: More conservative p-values

**Output columns:**

- **NGenes**: Number of genes in the pathway
- **Correlation**: Estimated inter-gene correlation
- **Direction**: "Up" or "Down" enrichment
- **PValue**: Raw p-value
- **FDR**: False discovery rate (Benjamini-Hochberg)

---

# 7. Annotate Results with Pathway Descriptions

Raw pathway IDs are not interpretable, so we'll add pathway names and descriptions.

## 7.1 Download KEGG Pathway Information

```{r download-kegg}
cat("Downloading KEGG pathway information...\n")

# Download KEGG data using clusterProfiler
kegg_info <- download_KEGG("hsa")

cat("\nStructure of downloaded data:\n")
str(kegg_info)
```

The `kegg_info` object contains:

- **KEGGPATHID2EXTID**: Maps pathway IDs to gene Entrez IDs
- **KEGGPATHID2NAME**: Maps pathway IDs to pathway names

## 7.2 Create Pathway Name Mapping

```{r pathway-names}
# Extract pathway names
pathway_names <- setNames(
  kegg_info$KEGGPATHID2NAME$to, 
  kegg_info$KEGGPATHID2NAME$from
)

cat("Pathway name mapping:\n")
cat("  Total pathways with names:", length(pathway_names), "\n\n")

cat("Example pathway names:\n")
print(head(pathway_names, 3))
```

## 7.3 Format and Add Descriptions to Results

```{r add-descriptions}
# Get pathway IDs from CAMERA results
pathway_ids <- rownames(camera_results)

# Pad pathway IDs with leading zeros to match KEGG format
# Example: "810" becomes "00810", then "hsa00810"
pathway_ids_padded <- sprintf("%05s", pathway_ids)
pathway_ids_formatted <- paste0("hsa", pathway_ids_padded)

cat("Example of ID formatting:\n")
formatting_example <- data.frame(
  Original = head(pathway_ids),
  Padded = head(pathway_ids_padded),
  Formatted = head(pathway_ids_formatted)
)
print(formatting_example)

# Add descriptions to results
camera_results$Description <- pathway_names[pathway_ids_formatted]

# Mark missing descriptions as NA
camera_results$Description[is.na(camera_results$Description)] <- NA

cat("\nDescriptions successfully added!\n\n")
cat("Top 10 pathways with descriptions:\n")
print(camera_results[1:10, c("NGenes", "Direction", "PValue", "FDR", "Description")])
```

**Why pad with zeros?**

- KEGG pathway IDs have 5 digits: "hsa00810", "hsa01100"
- Our data may have IDs without leading zeros: "810", "1100"
- We need to pad to match the KEGG format for lookup

---

# 8. Visualize Results

Visualization helps identify the most significant pathways and their direction of enrichment.

```{r visualize-results, fig.height=8}
# Select top pathways for visualization
top_n <- 15
top_pathways <- head(camera_results, top_n)

# Create barplot
par(mar = c(5, 15, 4, 2))
barplot(
  -log10(top_pathways$FDR),
  horiz = TRUE,
  names.arg = top_pathways$Description,
  las = 1,
  main = "Top KEGG Pathways (CAMERA Analysis)\nT-cell vs B-cell ALL",
  xlab = "-log10(FDR)",
  col = ifelse(top_pathways$Direction == "Up", "steelblue", "coral")
)
abline(v = -log10(0.05), lty = 2, col = "red")
legend("bottomright", 
       legend = c("Up in T-cell", "Down in T-cell", "FDR = 0.05"),
       fill = c("steelblue", "coral", NA),
       border = c("black", "black", NA),
       lty = c(NA, NA, 2),
       col = c(NA, NA, "red"))
```

**Interpretation:**

- **Blue bars**: Pathways up-regulated in T-cells (vs B-cells)
- **Coral bars**: Pathways down-regulated in T-cells (vs B-cells)
- **Red dashed line**: FDR = 0.05 significance threshold
- **Longer bars**: More significant enrichment

---

# 9. Summary of Significant Pathways

Let's quantify how many pathways are significantly enriched at different thresholds.

```{r significant-pathways}
# Extract significant pathways (FDR < 0.05)
significant_pathways <- camera_results[camera_results$FDR < 0.05, ]

cat("=======================================================\n")
cat("SUMMARY OF CAMERA RESULTS\n")
cat("=======================================================\n\n")

cat("Total pathways tested:", nrow(camera_results), "\n")
cat("Significant pathways (FDR < 0.05):", nrow(significant_pathways), "\n")
cat("  Up-regulated in T-cells:", sum(significant_pathways$Direction == "Up"), "\n")
cat("  Down-regulated in T-cells:", sum(significant_pathways$Direction == "Down"), "\n\n")

# Show additional significance thresholds
cat("Pathways at different FDR thresholds:\n")
cat("  FDR < 0.01:", sum(camera_results$FDR < 0.01), "\n")
cat("  FDR < 0.001:", sum(camera_results$FDR < 0.001), "\n\n")

# Show top significant pathways
cat("Top 10 most significant pathways:\n")
print(significant_pathways[1:min(10, nrow(significant_pathways)), 
                           c("NGenes", "Direction", "PValue", "FDR", "Description")])
```

---

# 10. Compare with Self-Contained Test (MROAST)

To understand the difference between competitive and self-contained tests, let's compare CAMERA with MROAST.

```{r compare-mroast}
cat("Running MROAST for comparison...\n")
cat("(Testing first 50 pathways for speed)\n\n")

# Run MROAST (self-contained test)
mroast_results <- mroast(
  y = exprs_data,
  index = gene_set_indices[1:min(50, length(gene_set_indices))],
  design = design,
  contrast = contrast_matrix[, "TvsB"],
  nrot = 999
)

cat("Top 10 pathways from MROAST:\n")
print(head(mroast_results, 10))
```

## 10.1 Compare Results

```{r compare-results}
# Compare pathways tested by both methods
common_pathways <- intersect(rownames(camera_results), rownames(mroast_results))

comparison <- data.frame(
  PathwayID = common_pathways,
  CAMERA_PValue = camera_results[common_pathways, "PValue"],
  MROAST_PValue = mroast_results[common_pathways, "PValue"],
  CAMERA_FDR = camera_results[common_pathways, "FDR"],
  MROAST_FDR = mroast_results[common_pathways, "FDR"],
  CAMERA_Direction = camera_results[common_pathways, "Direction"],
  MROAST_Direction = mroast_results[common_pathways, "Direction"]
)

cat("\nComparison of top 10 pathways:\n")
print(head(comparison[order(comparison$CAMERA_PValue), ], 10))

# Calculate correlation
cor_result <- cor(comparison$CAMERA_PValue, comparison$MROAST_PValue, 
                  method = "spearman")
cat("\nSpearman correlation between CAMERA and MROAST p-values:", 
    round(cor_result, 3), "\n")
```

**Key Differences:**

- **CAMERA** (competitive): Tests if pathway genes are MORE DE than other genes
- **MROAST** (self-contained): Tests if pathway genes are DE at all
- Results often agree, but can differ when:
  - Overall differential expression is high/low
  - Pathway genes have similar DE levels as background
  - Inter-gene correlation is strong

---

# 11. Understanding Inter-Gene Correlation

The `inter.gene.cor` parameter is crucial for CAMERA. Let's see how it affects results.

## 11.1 Effect of Different Correlation Values

```{r correlation-effect}
cat("Testing different inter.gene.cor values...\n\n")

# Test with different correlation assumptions
cor_values <- c(0.01, 0.05, 0.1, NA)
results_list <- list()

for (cor_val in cor_values) {
  label <- ifelse(is.na(cor_val), "Estimated", as.character(cor_val))
  
  cat("Running CAMERA with inter.gene.cor =", label, "...\n")
  
  results_list[[label]] <- camera(
    y = exprs_data,
    index = gene_set_indices[1:20],  # Test subset for speed
    design = design,
    contrast = contrast_matrix[, "TvsB"],
    inter.gene.cor = cor_val
  )
}

cat("\nComparison of top pathway with different correlation values:\n")
pathway_example <- names(gene_set_indices)[1]

comparison_cor <- data.frame(
  Correlation = names(results_list),
  PValue = sapply(results_list, function(x) x[pathway_example, "PValue"]),
  FDR = sapply(results_list, function(x) x[pathway_example, "FDR"]),
  Direction = sapply(results_list, function(x) x[pathway_example, "Direction"])
)
print(comparison_cor)
```

**Guidelines for inter.gene.cor:**

- **0.01**: Default, assumes weak correlation (conservative)
- **0.05-0.1**: For pathways with moderate correlation
- **NA**: Estimates from data (most accurate but slower)
- **Higher values**: More conservative p-values

## 11.2 When to Use Each Setting

```{r correlation-guidelines}
cat("\nGuidelines for choosing inter.gene.cor:\n\n")

guidelines <- data.frame(
  Setting = c("0.01 (default)", "0.05-0.1", "NA (estimate)", "0.2+"),
  `Use When` = c(
    "General analysis, quick results",
    "Known moderate pathway correlation",
    "Most accurate, worth the computation time",
    "Strong correlation expected (e.g., protein complexes)"
  ),
  Speed = c("Fast", "Fast", "Slow", "Fast"),
  Conservativeness = c("Moderate", "More conservative", "Data-driven", "Very conservative")
)

print(guidelines)
```

---

# 12. Advanced: Examining Specific Pathways

Let's examine some interesting pathways in detail.

```{r examine-pathways}
# Get top up and down-regulated pathways
top_up <- camera_results[camera_results$Direction == "Up", ][1:5, ]
top_down <- camera_results[camera_results$Direction == "Down", ][1:5, ]

cat("Top 5 up-regulated pathways in T-cells:\n")
print(top_up[, c("NGenes", "PValue", "FDR", "Description")])

cat("\nTop 5 down-regulated pathways in T-cells:\n")
print(top_down[, c("NGenes", "PValue", "FDR", "Description")])
```

## 12.1 Gene-Level Details for a Pathway

```{r pathway-genes}
# Select an interesting pathway
selected_pathway_id <- rownames(camera_results)[1]
selected_pathway_indices <- gene_set_indices[[selected_pathway_id]]

# Get gene-level statistics for this pathway
pathway_genes_stats <- topTable(
  fit2, 
  coef = "TvsB", 
  number = Inf,
  sort.by = "none"
)[selected_pathway_indices, ]

cat("Gene-level statistics for pathway:", 
    camera_results[selected_pathway_id, "Description"], "\n\n")

cat("Summary of log fold changes:\n")
print(summary(pathway_genes_stats$logFC))

cat("\nTop 10 genes in this pathway:\n")
print(head(pathway_genes_stats[order(pathway_genes_stats$P.Value), ], 10)[, 
           c("logFC", "AveExpr", "t", "P.Value", "adj.P.Val")])
```

---

# 13. Export Results

Save the results for further analysis or reporting.

```{r export-results, eval=FALSE}
# Create output directory
if (!dir.exists("results")) {
  dir.create("results")
}

# Export significant pathways
write.csv(
  camera_results,
  file = "results/camera_all_pathways.csv",
  row.names = TRUE
)

write.csv(
  significant_pathways,
  file = "results/camera_significant_pathways.csv",
  row.names = TRUE
)

# Export top genes for significant pathways
for (i in 1:min(5, nrow(significant_pathways))) {
  pathway_id <- rownames(significant_pathways)[i]
  pathway_indices <- gene_set_indices[[pathway_id]]
  
  pathway_stats <- topTable(
    fit2,
    coef = "TvsB",
    number = Inf,
    sort.by = "P"
  )[pathway_indices, ]
  
  filename <- paste0("results/pathway_", pathway_id, "_genes.csv")
  write.csv(pathway_stats, file = filename, row.names = TRUE)
}

cat("Results exported to 'results/' directory\n")
```

# 14. Key Concepts Summary

## CAMERA Characteristics

**Advantages:**

- Accounts for inter-gene correlation (genes don't act independently)
- More powerful than GSEA for moderate effect sizes
- Fast computation
- Provides directional enrichment
- Works well with any linear model design

**Limitations:**

- Requires appropriate inter.gene.cor setting
- Competitive test assumption may not suit all biological questions
- Requires sufficient genes per pathway (â‰¥10 recommended)

## When to Use CAMERA

Use CAMERA when:

1. **You want competitive testing**: Compare genes in pathway vs. all other genes
2. **You have a linear model**: Any design matrix that works with limma
3. **Inter-gene correlation matters**: Genes in pathways work together
4. **You need speed**: Testing many pathways quickly
5. **You want direction**: Know if pathways are up or down-regulated

Use ROAST/MROAST/FRY when:

1. **You want self-contained testing**: Test if pathway genes are DE
2. **You're skeptical of pathway definition**: Don't want to compare to background
3. **You have specific hypotheses**: Testing individual pathways

## Key Parameters

| Parameter | Purpose | Recommendations |
|-----------|---------|-----------------|
| `inter.gene.cor` | Controls correlation adjustment | 0.01 (default), NA (estimate), 0.05-0.1 (moderate) |
| `sort` | How to sort results | "directional" (default), "mixed", "none" |
| `min pathway size` | Filter small pathways | 10-15 genes minimum |
| `FDR threshold` | Significance cutoff | 0.05 (standard), 0.01 (stringent) |

---

# 15. Biological Interpretation

The pathways identified by CAMERA represent coordinated changes in gene expression between T-cell and B-cell ALL samples.

## Expected Biological Differences

B-cell and T-cell leukemias should show differences in:

- **Immune cell development pathways**: T-cell vs B-cell receptor signaling
- **Lineage-specific transcription factors**: Different master regulators
- **Cell surface markers**: CD markers specific to each lineage
- **Signaling pathways**: Different growth factor responses

## Validation Approaches

To validate CAMERA results:

1. **Literature review**: Check if pathways are known to differ between cell types
2. **Independent datasets**: Test on other B-cell vs T-cell comparisons
3. **Functional studies**: Experimental validation of key genes
4. **Cross-method validation**: Compare with GSEA, ROAST, or other methods
5. **Single-gene validation**: qPCR or other techniques for key genes

---

# 16. Conclusions

In this tutorial, we demonstrated:

1. **Data preparation**: Loading and preprocessing the ALL dataset
2. **Pathway mapping**: Converting probes to genes to pathways
3. **CAMERA analysis**: Competitive gene set testing
4. **Result annotation**: Adding pathway descriptions
5. **Visualization**: Graphical representation of results
6. **Comparison**: CAMERA vs. MROAST (competitive vs. self-contained)
7. **Parameter exploration**: Understanding inter.gene.cor
8. **Biological interpretation**: Making sense of the results

## Key Takeaways

- CAMERA is a powerful **competitive** gene set test
- Inter-gene correlation adjustment is crucial for valid p-values
- Pathway descriptions make results interpretable
- Compare with self-contained tests (ROAST/MROAST) for comprehensive analysis
- Minimum pathway size (10-15 genes) ensures statistical power
- Always validate significant findings with independent approaches
