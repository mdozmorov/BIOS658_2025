Presentation tips, https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6359286794227449856/

1. People remember the first 5% and the last 5%. In the middle 90% they only remember how they felt
2. Don’t obsess over slides. The best presenters don’t use them
3. Rehearse until it's in your DNA (rule of thumb is spend 10x longer rehearsing than the actual presentation)
4. Don’t worry if you don’t present exactly how you planned. Nobody knows what you were planning
5. Give the first 20 seconds as much impact as possible. Thank people later
6. Embrace nerves. It shows you're thinking about getting it right
7. Ignore the lectern. Step out
 8. You’ll sweat. It might be nerves or hot lights. Think about that when choosing your wardrobe
9. If you want to be great at presenting you need to first be bad at it. So present a lot and get the bad ones out the way
10. It’s not about you. It’s 100% about the audience. No exceptions
11. Presenting is an art not a sport. You’ll never win. You’ll never be perfect
12. Breathe. Don’t speak when you’re inhaling. Talk on the exhale. It will sound better
13. People won’t mind if you finish early (except the organisers). But everyone will care if you finish late
14. Own the whole stage
