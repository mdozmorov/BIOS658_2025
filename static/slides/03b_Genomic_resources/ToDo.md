Genomic coordinate system
For all genome intervals reported in the manuscript, we use a 0-based coordinate system (in which the
starting element receives an index of 0, the second receives an index of 1, etc.). Each 0-based interval
is non-inclusive or “half-open”, meaning that each reported interval includes the basepairs at the start
position (again, reported in a 0-based manner) up to the base pair at the end-1 position, and excludes
the base pair at the end position. The width of a 0-based interval is therefore simply end - start.
For variants, we follow the 1-based coordinate system that is conventional in the human genetics
literature.
